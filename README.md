# SimpleWeather

With more time, I would improve:
- Over-all design of the site, probably remove Bootstrap and code custom CSS
- Add some icons, like [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
- Make sure the site looks good in different screen sizes
- Cache the API responses
- Add an autocomplete for the `location` input with Google Places API
- Add option to select between Celcius and Fahrenheit degrees
